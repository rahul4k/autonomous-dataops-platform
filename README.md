# Autonomous DataOps Platform

An AI-powered, self-healing DataOps platform that uses autonomous agents to:
- Read and interpret pipeline logs
- Detect root causes of failure
- Generate optimized code fixes
- Open GitHub Pull Requests automatically
- Notify stakeholders across Slack/Email

This project demonstrates how large language models (LLMs), observability signals, and orchestration systems like Airflow can enable **autonomous data engineering workflows**.

## 📌 Key Features

### 🤖 Agentic Services
- **Log Reader Agent**: Extracts anomalies, regex patterns, and error signatures from logs.
- **Root-Cause Analysis Agent**: Maps log patterns to known failure classes.
- **Fixer/Optimizer Agent**: Generates improved Spark code using error context.
- **PR Generator Agent**: Integrates with GitHub to push fixes automatically.
- **Notifier Agent**: Sends alerts with RCA + recommended actions.

---

## 📡 Pipeline Automation
Includes:
- Sample **Airflow DAG**
- Sample **PySpark job (buggy)** and **fixed version (generated by agent)**

---

## ☁️ Cloud Setup (GCP)
Terraform templates for:
- Artifact Registry
- Cloud Composer (Airflow)
- GCS buckets
- Cloud Run (for agents)
- Service Accounts + IAM

---

## 🧠 Architecture
See `/docs/architecture.md`

## 🧪 Tests
Unit and integration tests for each agent.
